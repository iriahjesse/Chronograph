ChronoGraph: Embedded Linux Visualization System
Embedded Python visualization system featuring a custom time-to-coordinate mapping algorithm for a constrained SPI display.

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Overview & Objectives
This project is an Embedded Python application developed for a Raspberry Pi (Linux environment) that performs real-time data visualization. The core technical achievement is the design and implementation of low-level graphics rendering and a custom algorithm to plot dynamic time-series data onto a small-format, low-resolution ST7789 display.

Key Features and Accomplishments
Custom Cartesian Mapping Algorithm: Developed and implemented a unique linear interpolation algorithm to translate the 12-hour clock state (Hours √ó Minutes) into precise, custom Cartesian (X, Y) pixel coordinates for real-time plotting.

Low-Level Graphics Rendering: Utilized the Pillow (PIL) library to manually generate all visual elements, including the custom axes, markers, labels, and polygons, demonstrating command over graphics primitives.

High-Speed Hardware Interfacing: Configured the SPI bus at 64MHz for rapid display updates and managed GPIO control for display power and input buttons, ensuring reliable performance in the embedded environment.

Event-Driven Display Logic: Implemented button logic to switch between the real-time graph screen and a static key/title screen.

üõ†Ô∏è System Requirements & Setup
Hardware
Microprocessor: Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO header)

Display: Adafruit ST7789-based TFT Display (135x240 or compatible SPI display)

üß† Algorithm Spotlight: Time Mapping
The central challenge was converting time, which naturally loops (12 hours, 60 minutes), into a linear X, Y coordinate system for plotting on a fixed-size canvas.

The algorithm uses the display's fixed size (plotting_width, plotting_height) to scale the time data:

Time Component	Axis Mapped To	Mapping Logic (Conceptual)
Minute (0-59)	X-Axis (Horizontal)	X_coordinate = LEFT_PADDING + (Current Minute / 59) * Total Plot Width
Hour (1-12)	Y-Axis (Vertical)	Y_coordinate = BOTTOM_PADDING - ((Current Hour - 1) / 11) * Total Plot Height
This conversion allows the system to accurately place the time marker (labeled 'X') on the custom-rendered graph in real-time.
